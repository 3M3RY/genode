Manual modifications
####################

:'src/lib/include/rpcsvc/nis.x':

  CPP seems not to be able to parse splitted lines and so fails with
  'definition keyword expected' otherwise (though that's just a rough guess).

:'src/lib/libc/stdlib/malloc.c':

  Undefine 'MALLOC_DSS' to avoid the usage of sbrk.
  ! //#define	MALLOC_DSS

:'src/lib/libc/stdio/vfwprintf.c':

  Fix warnings caused by conversions between (char *) and (wchar_t *).
  This is just a cosmetic fix.

:'src/lib/libc/resolv/res_send.c':

  Disable usage of kqueue and fix building libresolv when kqueue is disabled.

:'src/lib/libc/include/unistd.h':

  Remove definitions for remote network commands over unencrypted streams.
