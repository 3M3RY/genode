The '9p_fs' server provides 'File_system' sessions to a remote 9P file server
over a TCP connection.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The connection to the server is configured using the attributes 'addr', 'port'
and 'message_size'.
! <config addr="10.0.2.2" port="564" message_size="8192"/>
The former is required, but the later two default to standard values.

The server maintains a single connection to the 9P server but can support
multiple client policies. Policy can specify a optional user and file tree,
though typically the remote server serves a single unamed tree. Client
sessions are read only by default; the default user is "glenda".
! <config addr="192.168.16.24">
!   <policy label="test-libc_vfs" user="glen"/>
!   <policy label="noux -> tmp"   user="glenda" access="tmp" writable="yes"/>
! </config>

Limitations
-----------

* Symbolic links are not included in the 9P2000 protocol. They are available
  however in the later 9P2000.L protocol, which is not currently supported.
* Move operations between directories is not implemented.
* Authentication is not implemented.
