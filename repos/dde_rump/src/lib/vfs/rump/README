The vfs_rump plugin enables access to block device backed file systems
supported by the rump kernel. A single rump kernel is in use for any
number of <rump> nodes. The configuration node takes two arguments:
'fs' specifies the file system type, and 'writeable' specifies if the
mount is read only or writeable, 'writeable' defaults to true.

Furthermore, the Rump kernel quota may be defined with the top-level
config node 'rump' and the attribute 'quota', and affects things such
as cache sizes within Rump. If ommited, a default is set to the
remaining quota of the host component minus 2 MB.

An example configuration:
! <config>
!  <rump quota="8M"/>
!  <vfs>
!   <rump fs="ext2fs"/>
!  </vfs>
! </config>
