Nic_report is a shim server that fowards a Nic session while
producing reports from the ROM sub-session. It can be used
to communicate the state of a Nic session to other components.
For example, a virtual machine instance may use the exported
Nic session as a backend for its virtual network device, but
the complexity required for the virtual machine monitor to
communicate the high-level session configuration directly to
the guest operating system cannot be justified. Using this
server, a script or utility native to the guest OS can perform
the interface configuration after parsing a report exported
to the guest over a common file system.

This server only introduces overhead when Nic sessions are
opened, in all other cases the client is addressing the backing
server directly by capability.


An example script to configure a Linux interface with a Nic
ROM is included at apply_nic_report.sh
