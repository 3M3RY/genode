RFC 4389                        ND Proxy                      April 2006

   When any other IPv6 multicast packet is received on a proxy
   interface, in addition to any normal IPv6 behavior such as being
   delivered locally, it is forwarded unchanged (other than using a new
   link-layer header) out all other proxy interfaces on the same link.
   (As specified in [BRIDGE], the proxy may instead support multicast
   learning and filtering, but this is OPTIONAL.)  In particular, the
   IPv6 Hop Limit is not updated, and no ICMP errors (except as noted in
   Section 4.1.1 below) are sent as a result of attempting this
   forwarding.
