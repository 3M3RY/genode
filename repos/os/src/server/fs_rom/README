The 'fs_rom' server translates the 'File_system' session interface to the
'ROM' session' interface. Each request for a ROM file is handled by looking
up an equally named file on the file system. By default the server will always
return a valid session if no such file could be found and will watch the file
system for the creation of the corresponding file. This behavior can be disabled
with a policy containg a negative 'wait' attribute and the server will reject
sessions for missing files. In both cases the server reflects file changes it
detects as signals to the ROM session.

Limitations
-----------

* Symbolic links are not handled
* The server needs to allocate RAM for each requested file. The RAM is always
  allocated from the RAM session of the server. The RAM quota consumed by the
  server depends on the client requests and the size of the requested files.
  Therefore, one instance of the server should not be used by untrusted clients
  and critical clients at the same time. In such situations, multiple instances
  of the server could be used.
