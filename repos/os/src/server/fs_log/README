LOG server that writes log messages onto a file system.

Log files are creating in a directory tree formed from session labels.
As an example the session label "init -> nitpicker" would create
a log file at "init/nitpicker.log". The behavior of opening two LOG
sessions with the same label is undefined.

The option to truncate files at the start of each LOG session is available
through session policy, as well the option to merge the logs of any
session matching a given policy.

:Example configuration:
! <start name="log_file">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="1M"/>
!   <provides><service name="LOG"/></provides>
!   <config>
!     <policy label="nic_drv" truncate="no"/>
!     <policy label="cli_monitor -> noux" merge="yes"/>
!     <policy label="" truncate="yes"/>
!   </config>
! </start>
